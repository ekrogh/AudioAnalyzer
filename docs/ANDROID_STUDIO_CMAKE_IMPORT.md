## Android Studio project generation (recommended: Projucer export)

This project ships with a script that generates a real Android Studio Gradle project using JUCE’s Android exporter (Projucer). It places the project under `Builds/Android` and patches it to use this repo’s root CMakeLists.txt so rnnoise and your JUCE setup are respected.

### Prerequisites
- Android Studio (latest stable) with SDK/NDK/CMake installed (via SDK Manager)
- Projucer.exe path (from a JUCE install/checkout)

### Fast path (PowerShell)
Run this in the repository root. The script will export and print the exact Gradle folder to open in Android Studio.

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\Generate-AndroidStudioProject.ps1 `
    -ProjucerPath "D:\\path\\to\\Projucer.exe" `
    -UseRootCMake `
    -RequireProjucerGradle
```

What happens
- Projucer is run headless to export the Gradle project to `Builds/Android`.
- The script patches `externalNativeBuild.cmake.path` to point at `../../../CMakeLists.txt` (repo root), so headers and the rnnoise target are included without editing generated files.
- The script prints the Gradle root it found, for example:

```
Android Studio Gradle project generated by Projucer at:
D:\Users\eigil\projects\juceProjs\AudioAnalyzer\Builds\Android
```

Open that printed folder in Android Studio (File > Open), click Sync, then Build > Make Project.

### Alternative (host CMake target)
If you prefer driving it from your host build, set these CMake cache vars and build the `android_studio` target:
- `PROJUCER_EXE` = path to Projucer.exe
- `ANDROID_STUDIO_USE_ROOT_CMAKE` = ON

This will run the same script and print the Gradle folder to open.

### Notes
- Re-running the script after a Projucer “resave” will re-patch the Gradle file automatically when `-UseRootCMake` is set.
- If Android Studio shows stale native includes, delete `app/.cxx` and `app/build/externalNativeBuild/cmake` in the Gradle project, then Sync/Build.

## Alternative: Native C++ import (no JUCE packaging)
If you only want to compile native code in Android Studio without JUCE’s APK packaging, you can import this repo’s CMake directly via a “Native C++” template. This compiles but does not produce a runnable APK.

1) Android Studio → New Project → Native C++
2) Set min SDK ≥ 24, Finish
3) Edit `app/build.gradle(.kts)` and point `externalNativeBuild.cmake.path` to your `AudioAnalyzer/CMakeLists.txt`
4) Sync and Build > Make Project

Use this only when you don’t need a full JUCE Android app wrapper.
